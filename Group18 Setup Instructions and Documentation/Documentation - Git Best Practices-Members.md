# ðŸ“‹ Best Practices for Team Members (Git + GitHub)

## âœ… 1. Start Every Work Session by Updating Main
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
âœ… Always work with the latest version.

---

## âœ… 2. Create a New Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```
Example:
```bash
git checkout -b add-footer
```
âœ… Isolate your changes safely.

---

## âœ… 3. Make Changes Locally
- Edit assigned files (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)
- Save changes properly.

---

## âœ… 4. Stage and Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Short clear message (e.g., Update footer section)"
```
âœ… Save your progress in Git.

---

## âœ… 5. Push Your Branch to GitHub
For the first push:
```bash
git push -u origin your-feature-branch
```
Afterward:
```bash
git push
```
âœ… Send your work to GitHub.

---

## âœ… 6. Notify the Team Leader
Send a quick message like:
> "Hi, I finished updating `add-footer` branch. It's ready for merging!"

---

## âœ… 7. Wait for Merge and Pull Again
After merging:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
âœ… Always update before starting new work.
